# UFO Game
### A recreation of the classic game, Hangman, with a sci-fi twist. Programmed in C++.

To-do list:
- Handle upper and lower case letters.
- Clear console on each guess iteration.
- Prevent invalid guesses (e.g. numbers or previously guessed letters).
- Add sleep time, to allow time to read the console output.
